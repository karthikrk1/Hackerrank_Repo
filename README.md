# Hackerrank_Repo

This repo contains some of the Hackerrank problems which I have solved classified based on the genre of the problems.
This repo will be updated as I solve some bunch of problems. I do not claim these are efficient solutions, but I have tried my best in arriving at a working solution,
while also being as efficient with my Data Structures and Algorithms as possible.

## Project Euler

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical and programming puzzles. More on [here] (https://projecteuler.net/)

I have started to solve some of these questions through the Hackerrank website, in which they have improved the original Project Euler questions to contain more
additonal challenges like increasing the limit and extending the problem in other ways. These have some Java codes, which are the ones I did earlier. The latest ones
are done in Python 3. I will try to modify the Java ones into Pythonic solutions over time, but for now, they will alone be in Java. I will be adding to this repo as I solve some more problems in this series.

## Algorithms

This is an exclusive focus on the implementation of algorithms. There are a variety of algorithms and we need to use our knowledge of the algorithms to use appropriate and efficient algorithms to solve the use case. Thhis section contains various sub sections like Graphs, Dynamic Program, Greedy Algorithms, NP Complete and so forth. A good starting point to prepare for Programming Challenges.
